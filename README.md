## Evolent Health Assessment


In traditional web applications, the client (browser) initiates the communication with the server by requesting a page. The server then processes the request and sends the HTML of the page to the client. In subsequent interactions with the page –e.g. the user navigates to a link or submits a form with data– a new request is sent to the server, and the flow starts again: the server processes the request and sends a new page to the browser in response to the new action requested by the client.

In Single-Page Applications (SPAs) the entire page is loaded in the browser after the initial request, but subsequent interactions take place through Ajax requests. This means that the browser has to update only the portion of the page that has changed; there is no need to reload the entire page. The SPA approach reduces the time taken by the application to respond to user actions, resulting in a more fluid experience.

The architecture of a SPA involves certain challenges that are not present in traditional web applications. However, emerging technologies like ASP.NET Web API, JavaScript frameworks like AngularJS and new styling features provided by CSS3 make it really easy to design and build SPAs.
